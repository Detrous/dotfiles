# Update CLAUDE.md

Update or create a CLAUDE.md file in the current project directory:

1. Check if `CLAUDE.md` exists in the current directory
2. If it exists, review and update it with:
   - Current project structure
   - Key commands and scripts
   - Important architectural decisions
   - Project-specific patterns to follow
3. If it doesn't exist, create a new one with:
   - Brief project overview (1-2 lines)
   - Essential commands only
   - High-level architecture points
   - Critical patterns to know
4. Keep content concise and focused
5. Show what was added/changed

Remember: CLAUDE.md should contain only project-specific guidance, not general best practices (those belong in the global CLAUDE.md).
