# Session Learning Summary

Please summarize what you've learned from this session about:
1. My coding preferences and patterns
2. Project-specific conventions or requirements
3. Any mistakes to avoid in the future
4. Important context that should be remembered

After summarizing, if there are important learnings that would help in future sessions, please update the CLAUDE.md files with these insights:
- Update the global CLAUDE.md (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) for general preferences that apply to all projects
- Update the local CLAUDE.md (if exists in the current project) for project-specific learnings

Focus on:
- Specific coding patterns I prefer
- Tools or libraries I use
- Workflow preferences
- Common issues and their solutions
