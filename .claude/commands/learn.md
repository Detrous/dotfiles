# Session Learning Summary

Please summarize what you've learned from this session about:
1. My coding preferences and patterns
2. Project-specific conventions or requirements
3. Any mistakes to avoid in the future
4. Important context that should be remembered

After summarizing, take these actions:

1. **Save useful learnings to basic-memory** - Store any valuable insights, patterns, or project-specific knowledge:
   - Technical decisions made during the session → `project-name/decisions/`
   - Discovered patterns or conventions → `project-name/analysis/`
   - Important project context → `project-name/reference/`
   - Issues encountered and solutions → `project-name/issues/`

2. **Update CLAUDE.md files** if there are general preferences that affect future coding:
   - Update the global CLAUDE.md (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) for general preferences that apply to all projects
   - Update the local CLAUDE.md (if exists in the current project) for project-specific learnings

Focus on:
- Specific coding patterns I prefer
- Tools or libraries I use
- Workflow preferences
- Common issues and their solutions
- Architecture decisions and rationale
